    <p class="paragraph_1">My name is Mahmoud Kahack, I was born in K&ouml;ln, Germany in 1997, but I was raised in Chicago, IL. My parents are originally from
        K&eacute;nitra, Morocco. I am a CS major at IIT and I am going into my Junior year. I am a code and history enthausist. Yea, those 
        are two completely different things but I can't help but love both. My interest in history accumulates in medieval history, 
        especially the history of the geo-political changes in medieval Europe. When it comes to programming, I am madly in love with low 
        level programing especially OS development. I am also interested in cyper security and wish to start my own security firm.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph_1">I mostly play video games and watch TV shows (excited to start watching Archer this week) in my free time. But typically I go out on 
        weekend nights. My favorite sport would be paintball although I don't paintball as much as would like. I also enjoy swimming and 
        I am notorious for jumping into lake Michigan in mid March and April just test out if the water is warm enough to swim in, ofcourse 
        its not. I also play chess and enjoy strategy games in general. On Steam I got CK2, Empire Total War, Shogun Total War, Democracy 3 just to name some 
        of the titles that in my library. I also have some FPS (Hero's and General's). I tend to spend more time on strategy games though. </p>
