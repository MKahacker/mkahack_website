    <p class="paragraph_1">My name is Mahmoud Abdellah Kahack, I was born in K&ouml;ln, Germany on February 14, 1997, but I spent most of 
        my childhood and adult life in the city of Chicago, IL. I grew up in a small neighborhood in the northside known as West Ridge. 
        It was a "regular" Chicago neighborhood except for the large number of Indians that lived around the area. In fact, it's informally
        known as "Little India". The food around this part of town is very spicy and characterised by a strong auroma of tumeric and red pepper.
        In fact, if you walk along Devon Ave you will feel like you had entered a portal to a street in Hyderabad, India. Resaurants, sweet
        shops, clothing stores, and the three grocery stores all serve to remind you of the scenes that you can encounter in an Indian city. 
        I was homeschooled until about the 3rd grade. That is until I started attending Chicago Virtual Charter School the first virtual public
        school in Chicago. I finished both my middleschool and highschool at CVCS and I began my college career at IIT. I am a CS major at IIT 
        and will hopefully be graduating in 2019. I am a code and history enthausist. Yea, those are two completely different things but I can't help but love both. 
        My interest in history is mostly focused on medieval history, especially the geo-political history of medieval Europe. When it comes 
        to programming, I am madly in love with low level programing especially Systems Programming. I am also interested in cyper security 
        and wish to start my own security firm.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph_1">I mostly play video games and watch TV shows in my free time. My favorite sport would be paintball although I don't paintball as much as would like. I also enjoy swimming and 
        I am notorious for jumping into lake Michigan in mid March and April just test out if the water is warm enough to swim in, ofcourse 
        its not. I also play chess and enjoy strategy games in general. On Steam I got CK2, Empire Total War, Shogun Total War, Democracy 3 just to name some 
        of the titles that in my library. I also have some FPS (Hero's and General's). I tend to spend more time on strategy games though. </p>
