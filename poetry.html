      <h2><em>Writer's Block</em></h2>
      <p>I sat and couldn't think no more<br>
        My thoughts they walked straight out the door<br>
        And here I sat waiting for more<br>
        Staring at the paper till my eyes were soar<br>
        My notebook empty from A to Z<br>
        What could I do to rhyme with Z<br>
        I sat around and thought of me<br>
        My life and what I ought to be<br>
        Yet, the siege on my mind was unbroken<br>
        My mind was sleeping it seemed broken<br>
        I would stare at the paper and try to write<br>
        But my words seemed to be lost in flight<br>
        I waited waited and then a spark<br>
        I saw over there in the dark<br>
        Suddenly waves of ideas came to be<br>
        And my mind bloomed like the blossom tree<br>

      <h2><em>Sitting Side by Side</em></h2>
      <p>Sitting side by side<br>
          And I wouldn't have lied<br>
          If I said they were identical<br>
          Parts of the same tentical<br>
          Brick and mortar offsprings<br>
          Of the old rock minings<br>
          Sitting side by side<br>
          In the city and the countryside<br>
